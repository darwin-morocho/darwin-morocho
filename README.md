## About Me

Full-stack and Mobile developer with extensive experience in the development of native and multi-platform mobile applications for iOS and Android. With solid knowledge in technologies such as nodejs, React, express, react native, flutter, angular, next.js, mongoDB, graphql, firebase. I think graphic design and user experience are as important as programming. I'm always looking to experiment with new technologies for modern software development.

In my free time I like to create only course for [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/darwin-morocho/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOBzaZBxsuWARwfmeIgvdQ) and **[meedu.app](https://meedu.app)**(My own courses platform)
