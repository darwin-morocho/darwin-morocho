## About Me

Mobile developer with extensive experience in the development of native and multi-platform mobile applications for iOS and Android. 



With solid knowledge in technologies such as
Mobile:
- Native android apps with java and kotlin. 
- Native ios apps with swift. 
- Multiplaform apps with flutter ‚ô•Ô∏è. 
- Multiplaform apps with react native üôÉ. 
- Firebase auth, messaging, realtime databases, storage, crashlythics. 



Web and backend skills: 

nodejs, React, express, next.js, mongoDB, graphql, firebase. 

I think graphic design and user experience are as important as programming. I'm always looking to experiment with new technologies for modern software development.

In my free time I like to create courses for [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/darwin-morocho/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOBzaZBxsuWARwfmeIgvdQ) and **[meedu.app](https://meedu.app)**(My own courses platform)
